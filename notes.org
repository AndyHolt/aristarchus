* Project progress, goals, scope, milestones
- [X] Set up SQLite database
- [ ] Create Go app to provide abilities to add, modify, view and delete books
  from library (manually) -- CRUD
- [ ] Search interface
- [ ] Add books by ISBN or title/author and automatically fetch data
- [ ] Provide API for dealing with data in JSON
- [ ] Create React frontend for interacting
- [ ] Consider how to use multiple users
- [ ] Add categories for books, allowing browsing in different categories
- [ ] Advanced search options for various fields
* Issues and technical notes
- Currently using SQLite3 database, seems well suited to this as a personal
  project. But probably not suited to scaling to production, so will probably
  need to swap out to a MySQL or PostgreSQL database for deployment.
