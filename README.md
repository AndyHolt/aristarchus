# Aristarchus, the library 📚 manager

Named after Ἀρίσταρχος ὁ Σαμόθραξ, head librarian of the Library of Alexandria
c. 153--145 BC.

> It said that Aristarchus had a remarkable memory and was completely
> indifferent as to his external appearance.

This digital Aristarchus also has a remarkable memory and prizes function over
appearance, but seeks to be beautiful in form too.
